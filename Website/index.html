            <h2>How has F1 Changed Over Time?</h2>

            <p>Formula 1 is the fastest and most popular motorsport in the world. F1 has a rich history dating back to 1950, 
                undergoing remarkable transformation from a British gentleman's sport to a global phenomenon 
                pushing the technological boundaries of what's possible on four wheels. Today's F1 cars are capable of 
                reaching speeds up to 375 kph (233 mph). Behind the wheel, 10 teams with 20 elite drivers from diverse backgrounds 
                compete in a series of races called Grand Prix. across legendary circuits, from the vintage and narrow streets of Monaco to 
                the futuristic tracks in Abu Dhabi and Singapore. The sport's prestigious image is drived by its iconic 
                teams like Ferrari, McLaren, and Aston Martin, whose decades long engineering battle shapes the evolution of Formula 1.
                The sport has also exploded in popularity in the United States, fueled by Netflix's <i>Drive to Survive</i> and new races in Miami 
                and Las Vegas. 
                <br><br>
                This analysis aims data to decode the data behind F1's evolution, tracking the changes in performance, technology, driver demographics, 
                and global reach. We explore the motorsport's journey from its European roots to its status as a global and cultural phenomenon. 
                Moreover, we will look at key milestones in safety, sustainability, and technical regulations and how they have not only redefined F1 but 
                also influenced the future of motorsport as a whole. Through this study, we will assess the impact of regulations and innovations, and
                highlight how F1 continues to push the limits of what's possible on four wheels.

            <h2><u>Our Analysis</u></h2>

            <p>
                To understand how Formula 1 has evolved over the decades, we used a relational database structure
                combining many smaller datasets from Kaggle to give us comprehensive data that captures key aspects of 
                the motorsport. The dataset design we utilized allows us to explore complex relationships between different 
                entities, <br>linking drivers to their teams (constructors), race results, championships, circuits, 
                lap times, and pit stops from 1950 to 2024. 
                Each of our visualizations highlights a different facet of F1, revealing the dramatic transformations 
                the sport has undergone. From technological advancements in car design, to new regulations and globalization of
                drivers, circuits, and teams.
                Our analysis aims to capture the key milestones and elements that have shaped each season. Examples include
                new circuit additions, engine innovations, design regulation shifts, and major safety overhauls.

            <h3>Strategic Eras in Formula 1</h3>
            <p>The data reveals distinct strategic periods that transcend individual circuits:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Refueling Era (1996-2002):</strong> Predominantly late-race fastest laps (laps 60-75) across Monaco, US, and German circuits, as lighter fuel loads after final pit stops allowed maximum performance in closing stages</li>
                
                <li><strong>Transition Period (2003-2009):</strong> A dramatic shift to early-race fastest laps visible across multiple circuits – German GP (lap 8, 2005), Singapore (lap 14, 2008), and Bahrain (lap 9, 2009). This period coincided with qualifying fuel rules that created short, light-fuel performance windows</li>
                
                <li><strong>Post-Refueling Adaptation (2010-2013):</strong> Following the 2010 refueling ban, fastest laps moved significantly later in races, evident at the German GP (laps 60+) and Abu Dhabi (consistently around lap 50) as teams optimized for Pirelli's high-degradation tires</li>
                
                <li><strong>Hybrid Power Unit Era (2014-2018):</strong> More consistent fastest lap timing across circuits (laps 40-55) as energy management requirements created predictable performance windows. This consistency is particularly visible when comparing the stable patterns at Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, and Singapore</li>
                
                <li><strong>Fastest Lap Point Era (2019-2024):</strong> Notable spikes in 2019 (like Abu Dhabi's lap 70) followed by strategic late-race fastest laps, reflecting teams making dedicated pit stops to pursue the championship point introduced that year</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Circuit-Specific Influences on Fastest Lap Patterns</h3>
            <p>While regulatory eras shape overall trends, the data clearly reveals how each circuit's unique characteristics create distinctive fastest lap patterns:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Street vs. Purpose-Built Circuits:</strong> Street circuits like Monaco and Singapore consistently show greater variability in fastest lap timing compared to purpose-built facilities like Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Monaco's exceptional range (from lap 9 to lap 78 across different years) demonstrates how the high-risk, low-overtaking nature of street circuits forces teams into more diverse strategic approaches based on track position.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Track Length and Configuration:</strong> The visualization reveals how circuit layout affects optimal performance windows. Abu Dhabi's consistently high lap numbers (45-55) reflect its long straights and technical final sector that benefit from lighter fuel loads, while Singapore's mid-race fastest laps (typically around lap 50, as shown in the tooltip) correspond to its demanding layout where tire degradation creates a narrower performance window.</li>
